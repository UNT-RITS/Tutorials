# About Python 

Python is one of the most popular high-level languages on Talon3. 

A Python code/program/script is a collection of commands in a file designed to be executed in a particular sequence in order to perform a specific task. 

Ways of running Python code:

* **offline on your computer**: 
  * from an editor: 
  * from your terminal: 
    * run a script:
      * from Windows:
      * from Mac, Linux, BSD, Unix, etc.:
    * execute a program using Shell:

  **Pros**: it can be used without an internet connection.
  
  **Cons**: it can't be shared easily and you can't have acces from any device.

* **online on browser**: Installing PyCharm (or any software) can be a little difficult for a newbie. Fortunately, there are many online resources to get familiar with the syntax and the features of Python before proceeding to install Python in the local machine.

  [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) (“Colab”, for short) and [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/try) are some of the most popular online platforms that allow you to write and execute Python in your browser.

  **Pros**: you can easily share the code with your collegues and work on it simultaneously; you can run only parts of the code, not the entire project everytime.
  
  **Cons**: doesn't have much memory you can play with.

* **online on HPC**:
  - from your terminal
  - from browser

  **Pros**: Talon3 has many versions of python that you can use and it is very useful for when you have a complex code.
  
  **Cons**: I can't find any.
