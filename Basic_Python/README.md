# About Python 

Python is one of the most popular high-level languages on Talon3. 

A Python code/program/script is a collection of commands in a file designed to be executed in a particular sequence in order to perform a specific task. 

Ways of running Python code:
* **offline on your computer**: A guide for installing python can be found [here](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/first-program). 

  **Pros**: it can be used without an internet connection.
  
  **Cons**: it can't be shared easily and you can't have acces from any device.

* **online on browser**: [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) (“Colab”, for short) is an online platform that allows you to write and execute Python in your browser.

  **Pros**: you can easily share the code with your collegues and work on together simultaneously; you can run only parts of the code, not the entire project everytime.
  
  **Cons**: doesn't have much memory you can play with.

* **on HPC**:
  - from your terminal
  - from browser

  **Pros**: Talon3 has many versions of python that you can use.
  **Cons**:
