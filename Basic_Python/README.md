# About Python 

Python is one of the most popular high-level languages on Talon3. It is mainly used for software development, scripting, and artificial intelligence. It works on multiple platforms, such as: Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi etc.

A Python code/program/script is a collection of commands in a file designed to be executed in a particular sequence in order to perform a specific task. 

Ways of running Python code:

* **offline on your computer**: 

  * from an IDE/Editor: [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is the most popular IDE followed by Spider, Idle and Eclipse, while [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) is the most popular Editor, followed by Atom, Visual Studio Code and Vim .

  **Pros**: It can be used without an internet connection.
  
  **Cons**: It can't be shared easily and you can't have acces to your code from any device.  
  
  * from your terminal: 
    * run a script:
      * on Windows: _tutorial needed_
      * on Mac, Linux, BSD, Unix, etc.: _tutorial needed_
    * execute a program using Shell: _tutorial needed_

  **Pros**: Faster as you only have to type a command and then press the enter key to get the results.
  
  **Cons**: Editing the code in this mode is hard as you have to move back to the previous commands or else you have to rewrite the whole command again.

* **online on browser**: Installing PyCharm (or any software) can be a little difficult for a newbie. Fortunately, there are many online resources to get familiar with the syntax and the features of Python before proceeding to install Python in the local machine.

  [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) (“Colab”, for short) and [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/try) are some of the most popular online platforms that allow you to write and execute Python in your browser.

  **Pros**: you can easily share the code with your collegues and work on it simultaneously; you can run only parts of the code, not the entire project everytime.
  
  **Cons**: doesn't have much memory you can play with.

* **online on HPC**: 
  - from your terminal:  _tutorial needed_
  - from browser: _tutorial needed_

  **Pros**: Talon3 has many versions of python that you can use and it is very useful for when you have a complex code.
  
  **Cons**: I can't find any. 

This repo provides the following tutorials:

1. [Python code structure](https://github.com/UNT-RITS/Tutorials/blob/master/Basic_Python/Python%20code%20structure.md)
2. How to upload your dataset
3. How to manipulate .csv files with Python
4. How to run a job on HPC

TIPS AND TRICKS in learning to code (applicable to any programming language):

  ★	Try to write the commands on your own to get used to the syntax. Avoid the copy-paste.
  
  ★	Upload some toy dataset and start playing around – apply any function/method and see how it works and if you can handle it.
  
  ★	Got an error? Try to read carefully the output message, it might be intuitive. No? – Google it!
