Python is one of the most popular high-level languages on Talon3. It is mainly used for software development, scripting, and artificial intelligence. It works on multiple platforms, such as: Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi etc.

A Python code/program/script is a collection of commands in a file designed to be executed in a particular sequence in order to perform a specific task. 

**NOTE.** This tutorial is only for educational purpose. It is not an academic paper. All references are listed at the end of the file.

## B. Artificial Neural Networks with Python

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is a domain in Computer Science. Considering the field of applience, AI has the following branches: 
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** (for text applications, such as: _text summarization, machine translation,_ etc.), 
- **Computer Vision (CV)** (for images/videos applications, such as: _object detection, pattern recognition,_ etc.) 
- **Automated Speech Recognision (ASR)** (for audio applications, such as: _speech-to-text, sound generation,_ etc.).

In AI the code is _dynamic_ and able to _learn by itself_, “observing” (word substitute for “applying mathematical magic beasts”) other similar situations. Those special types of codes are named Artificial Neural Networks. They aim to keep up with this ever-changing world by self-adapting and learning on the fly.  

In order to understand the AI concepts you need distinguish between its goals and its techniques:
- AI has a set of **goals** that represent what the AI system can do. Some of those goals include: _object recognition, object manipulation, classifying documents,_ and so on.
- AI uses some programming **techniques** (algorithms) in order to achieve its goals. Some of those techniques include: _data pre-processing, statistical & probabilities methods, mathematical optimizations,_ and so on.

If you want to apply some of the exciting models that creates false images or videos of celebrities or drive self-driving cars, or if you just wonder about what Artificial Inteligence is about, you might find this repository useful.

This repository exposes all the terminology used in Neural Networks, as well as it presents and explains the most common used algorithms that you need to know in order to understand how to build your own model.

_That moment when you think AI is easy and you get sucked in by all the tutorials:_
