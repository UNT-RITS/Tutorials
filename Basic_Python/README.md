# About Python :thought_balloon:

Python is one of the most popular high-level languages on Talon3. It is mainly used for software development, scripting, and artificial intelligence. It works on multiple platforms, such as: Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi etc.

A Python code/program/script is a collection of commands in a file designed to be executed in a particular sequence in order to perform a specific task.

## :bulb: TIPS AND TRICKS in learning to code (applicable to any programming language):

    ★	Try to write the commands on your own to get used to the syntax. Avoid the copy-paste.

    ★	Upload some toy dataset and start playing around – apply any function/method and see how it works and if you can handle it.

    ★	Got an error? Try to read carefully the output message, it might be intuitive. No? – Google it!
