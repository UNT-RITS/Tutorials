# More about IDEs and Code Editors for Python

## What is the difference between an IDE and a Code Editor?

An **IDE** (Integrated Development Environment) is a program specifically designed for software development. When you install an IDE, it usually come with tools such as:

- Editor: designed to handle code (responsible for syntax highlighting and auto-completion)

- Build, execution, and debugging features

- Source control

A **code editor** is like a text editor with syntax highlighting and code formatting features. Most good code editors can:

- Execute code and control a debugger

- The very best ones: interact with source control systems as well. 

Compared to an IDE, a good dedicated code editor is usually smaller and quicker, but has less cool features.
