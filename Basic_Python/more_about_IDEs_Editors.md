## What is the difference between an IDE and a Code Editor?

An **IDE** (Integrated Development Environment) is a program specifically designed for software development. When you install an IDE, it usually comes with tools such as:

- Editor: designed to handle code (responsible for syntax highlighting and auto-completion)

- Build, execution, and debugging features

- Source control

A **code editor** is like a text editor with syntax highlighting and code formatting features. Most good code editors can:

- Execute code and control a debugger

- The very best ones: interact with source control systems as well. 

Compared to an IDE, a good dedicated code editor is usually smaller and quicker, but has less cool features.

## IDEs

1. [PyCharm]() 

2. [Eclipse]()

3. [Visual Studio]()


### 1. PyCharm

### 2. Eclipse

### 3. Visual Studio

[Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/) is a full-featured IDE, in many ways comparable to Eclipse. Built for Windows and Mac OS only, VS comes in both free (Community) and paid (Professional and Enterprise) versions. Visual Studio enables development for a variety of platforms and comes with its own marketplace for extensions.

Pros: Enables Python coding in Visual Studio, as well as Intellisense for Python, debugging, and other tools.

Cons: Visual Studio is a big download for just Python. Plus, if you’re on Linux, you’re out of luck: there’s no Visual Studio install for that platform.

## Editors

1. [PyCharm]() 

2. [Eclipse]()

3. [Visual Studio Code]()

### 1. Sublime Text

[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) is an extremely popular code editor. Available on all platforms, it has Python code editing support and a variant set of packages for syntax and editing features.

**Pros**: It has a great following in the community. As a code editor, alone, Sublime Text is fast, small, and well supported.

**Cons**: It is not open-source (free), although you can use the demo version for an indefinite period of time. 

### 2. Atom

[Atom](https://atom.io/) is an open-source editor, with a sleek interface, file system browser, and marketplace for extensions. Available on all platforms, it has Python code editing support by an extension that can be installed when Atom is running.

**Pros**: Atom is small, so it downloads and loads fast.

**Cons**: The build and debugging support aren’t built-in. 

### 3. Visual Studio Code
