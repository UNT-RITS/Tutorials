## What is an Artificial Neural Network?
**Artificial Neural networks (ANN)** are a set of algorithms, modeled in a similar way the human brain works, developed to recognize and predict patterns. They interpret given data through a machine perception, using labeling or collecting raw input. The patterns they recognize are numerical, expressed as vectors, and so is the output before having assigned a meaning (check this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk) explanation). 
Therefore, it is essential to convert the real-world input data, like images, sounds or text, into numerical values.

Most of the existing neural networks architectures are shown in Figure 1.

Deep learning is the name we use for _“stratified neural networks”_ = **networks composed of several layers**.

The layers are represented by a column vector and the elements of the vector can be thought of as _nodes_ (also named _neurons_ or _units_).

A **node (neuron)** is just **a place where computation happens**. It receives input from some other nodes, or from an external source and computes the outcome. Each input has an associated **weight (w)**, which is assigned on the basis of its relative importance to other inputs. Then, the output is computed by combining a set of **coefficients**, or **weights**, that either _amplify_ or _reduce_ that input depending on its importance. 

The input-weights are multiplied between each other and summed up. The sum is passed through a node’s so-called **activation function**, to determine whether or to what extent that signal should progress further through the network to affect the ultimate outcome. If the signal passes through, the neuron has been **activated**.
