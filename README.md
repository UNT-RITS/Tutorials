# About HPC (Talon3) :mag_right:

This repo contains various tutorials and example projects using HPC.

## What is UNT HPC?

UNT HPC is a part of Research IT Services, offering state-of-the-art computing, storage, visualization, and networking service to the university. We help researchers and other members of UNT use advance computing power to enable higher research throughput and expand research capabilities.

## HPC Flagship Resources

Talon 3 is the main computing facility that RITS supports which contains:
 - More than 8,300 CPU cores
 - 150,000 GPU cores
 - Mellanox FDR InfiniBand network
 - Over 1.4 Petabytes of Lustre File Storage
